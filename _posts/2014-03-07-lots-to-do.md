title: IATI Tech - there's a lot to do!

*By David Carpenter*

In a week where we held a sprint on our work on the
[Dashboard](http://iati.github.io/IATI-Dashboard/) and killed off a few issues,
it was nice to see a few more pages onto the Dashboard that help us get an
overview of the tasks ahead. Making use of the [GitHub
API](http://developer.github.com/v3/) we now have three pages that let us see,
at a glance, how we are doing.

Our [Overview page](http://iati.github.io/IATI-Dashboard/github.html)
helps us see at a  glance what we need to do. Our [Milestones page]
(http://iati.github.io/IATI-Dashboard/milestones.html) is useful to see
at a glance what is due, and also helps us see issues that are yet to
be assigned to milestones and so on. It's also nice to have a reminder
that somwtimes things do actually get done, so the [Completed
Milestones](http://iati.github.io/IATI-Dashboard/milestones-completed.html)
is a way of seeing that.

Of course there are the [Organisation pages on github itself](https://github.com/orgs/IATI/dashboard) that also
give other views on our GitHub work and tasks

The code that generates the Dashboard can be found 
[on github](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard) if you are interested
